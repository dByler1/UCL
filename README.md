# GENERAL LISTINGS APP

## About This Project

This is a Node/Express/React app with a Mongo DB and Mongoose model

Authentication is achieved using the Passport package. 

The navigation passes login and business data prior to page render for maximum speed. This can be found in client --> src --> app.js. 

## App Story

This app connects homeservice professionals and homeowners. Homeservice professionals like plumbers and electricians can create an attractive and descriptive but straightforward profile. Homeowners can search for services, find professionals, review their capabilities, and contact them. 

This is not a lead gen app (Home Advisor, Angies List...etc). 

An example of a functional, profitable profile can be found at [Universal Chimney Lining](https://www.universalchimneylining.com/).
